============

Scaffolding generates classes, mappings, and tests.

Start by installing the scaffolder from a command prompt:

```
dotnet tool install -g griffin.data.scaffolding
```

Next, go into your data project folder and run it.

```
dotnet gd generate
```

Once done, you will have th queries, mappings, entities and everything required.

Reorganize the files to your liking.
