Scaffolding
============

Scaffolding generates classes, mappings and tests.

Start by installing the scaffolder from a command prompt:

```
dotnet tool install -g griffin.data.scaffolding
```

Next go into one of your data project and run it.

```
dotnet gd generate
```

Once done, you will have both queries, mappings, entities and everything required.

Reorganize the files to your liking.
