One to many
===========

One to many means that one class has a collection of children in a property.

```csharp
public class User
{
    public IList<Address> Addresses { get; set; }
}
```

If you are designing business entites, the above code is flawed, since the Â´User` looses control of it's children. It cannot check if the child is valid for it, since children can be added directly to the collection.

A better design is to use `IReadOnlyList<Address>` interface since it prevents direct adds to the collection:


```csharp
public class User
{
    private List<Address> _addresses = new List<Address>();

    public IReadOnlyList<Address> Addresses => _addresses;

    public void Add(Address address)
    {
        if (address.Country != "Sweden") {
            throw new ArgumentException("Sorry, but this awesomeness is only for Swedes and other vegetables.");
        }

        _addresses.Add(address);
    }
}
```

A sharp eye mights see that the `Address` property do not have any accessors (get/set). That's OK as long as the backing field is named as the property (`SomeProperty => _someProperty`).

## Complete example

Here is a minimal complete example.

First we have a parent and child class:

```csharp
public class SomeParent
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public IList<SomeChild> Children { get; set; }
}

public class SomeChild
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int ParentId { get; set; }
    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }
}
```

The relationship configuration is done in the parent mapping.

```csharp
internal class SomeParentMapping : IEntityConfigurator<SomeParent>
{
    public void Configure(IClassMappingConfigurator<SomeParent> config)
    {
        config.Key(x => x.Id).AutoIncrement();

        config.HasMany(x => x.Children)   // Child property in the arent class.
            .ForeignKey(x => x.ParentId)  // FK property in the child class (SomeChild).
            .References(x => x.Id);       // property in the main entity (SomeParent) that the FK references.
        
        config.MapRemaningProperties();
    }
}
```

The child class contains a standard mapping.

```csharp
internal class SomeChildMapping : IEntityConfigurator<SomeChild>
{
    public void Configure(IClassMappingConfigurator<SomeChild> config)
    {
        config.Key(x => x.Id).AutoIncrement();
        config.MapRemaningProperties();
    }
}
```

Finally, two tables need to be defined.

```sql
create table SomeParents
(
    Id int not null identity primary key
)

create table SomeChildren
(
    Id int not null identity primary key,
    SomeParentId int not null constraint FK_SomeParentId_SomeParents foreign key references SomeParents(Id)
    SomeProperty varchar(40) not null
)
```

## Inheritance

Inheritance in one to many relationships are a challenge since the collection of children can have different subclasses. That means that the parent
table cannot contain the type, nor the child tables (as that would require a query against all possible child tables).

Therefore, inheritance is not supported in has many relationships directly. You can however create a connection table that are used to tell which child type to load.

```csharp
public class SomeParent
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public IList<ChildConnector> Children { get; set; }
}

// Class used to tell which type the child is
public class ChildConnector
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

    // Must be included so that the correct connectors
    // are loaded by the library.
    public int ParentId  { get; set; }

    // This property is used to load the correct type
    // The type of field doesn't matter for the library.
    // enum, string or int are the most common.
    public string DataType { get; set; }

    // The correct child is loaded into this property.
    public IData { get; set; }
}

// We need a base, can either be a class or an interface.
public interface IData
{
    // All children must have a parent Id
    // that referes to SomeParent in this case.
    int ParentId { get; set; }
}

// Finally one of the sub classes.
public class SomeData : IData
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int ParentId { get; set; }
    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }
}
```

Take advantage of this structure by moving all common column/properties into the ChildConnector class and then have only sub class specific data in the sub classes.

The mappings looks like normal one to many mappings, but with a discriminator configuration:

```csharp
internal class SomeParentMapping : IEntityConfigurator<SomeParent>
{
    public void Configure(IClassMappingConfigurator<SomeParent> config)
    {
        config.Key(x => x.Id).AutoIncrement();

        config.HasMany(x => x.Children)   // Child property in the arent class.
            .ForeignKey(x => x.ParentId)  // FK property in the child class (SomeChild).
            .References(x => x.Id);       // property in the main entity (SomeParent) that the FK references.
        
        config.MapRemaningProperties();
    }
}

internal class ChildConnectorMapping : IEntityConfigurator<ChildConnector>
{
    public void Configure(IClassMappingConfigurator<ChildConnector> config)
    {
        config.Key(x => x.Id).AutoIncrement();

        // subclass configuration is activated by the
        // discriminator.
        config.HasOne(x => x.Data)
              .Discriminator(x => x.DataType, ChildSelector) 
              .ForeignKey(x => x.ParentId)
              .References(x => x.Id);

        config.MapRemaningProperties();
    }

    private Type? ChildSelector(string arg)
    {
        return arg switch
        {
            "SomeData" => typeof(SomeData),
            "MoreData" => typeof(Moredata),
            _ => null
        };
    }    
}


internal class SomeChildMapping : IEntityConfigurator<SomeChild>
{
    public void Configure(IClassMappingConfigurator<SomeChild> config)
    {
        config.Key(x => x.Id).AutoIncrement();
        config.MapRemaningProperties();
    }
}
```

The tables are the same, except the junction table and updated foreign keys.

```sql
create table SomeParents
(
    Id int not null identity primary key
)

create table ChildConnector
(
    Id int not null identity primary key,
    SomeParentId int not null constraint FK_SomeParentId_SomeParents foreign key references SomeParents(Id)
    DataType varchar(40) not null
)

create table SomeChildren
(
    Id int not null identity primary key,
    SomeParentId int not null constraint FK_SomeParentId_SomeParents foreign key references SomeParents(Id)
    SomeProperty varchar(40) not null
)
```

## Restrictions

The following restrictions apply to has many mappings.

### Must be an interface

The collection property must be an interface and not a concrete type.

The following interfaces are supported:

* `IEnumerable<T>`
* `IReadOnlyList<T>`
* `IList<T>`
* `T[]` (arrays)
